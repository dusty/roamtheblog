** TDOCUMENTATION IS IN PROGRESS **

Simple Blog/CMS Software that runs http://roamthepla.net.

Features

  * sinatra
  * mustache
  * mongodb
 
Clean default template setup for use with:
  * disqus
  * google analytics
  * feedburner
  * facebook
  * youtube
  * twitter

Requirements
  Roamtheblog saves its data to a MongoDB database.  If you don't want to run
  your own, I recommend using Mongo Machine (mongomachine.com).
  
  You will need access to a server that can run ruby code.  If you don't
  want to run your own, I recommend using Heroku (heroku.com).
  
Optimizations
  Roamtheblog is optimized to run on Heroku by setting a Cache-Control header
  to 300 seconds by default.  You can adjust that number as you wish in the
  Settings panel.
  
  Heroku or any other host that runs a cache such as Varnish in front of your
  app, will honor this number and cache pages for this long. This means your
  app is only hit once every 5 minutes for each page.  The rest of the
  requests are served by the cache server.  
  
  This will speed up the site and help to keep your Heroku account free by
  limiting the number of requests that your app needs to serve.

Installation (needs further explanation)
  - create mongomachine account
  - create github account
  - create heroku account
  - git clone the app
  - setup required variables
  - deploy to heroku
  - login to admin panel
  - change username/password

Settings
  You can create any settings you want in the admin settings section and
  use them in your templates.

  For example, if you create a setting named 'flickr' with the value of
  'myflickr', then you can use {{setting_flickr}} in any of your templates 
  and it will be replaced with the value of 'myflickr'
    
Templates
  You can create a template for displaying the html of your pages.  By default
  a copy of the template used on roamthepla.net is included.  You can copy
  this template and make changes to it, or create your own.  Whenever you like
  you can switch between templates in the admin panel.
  
  Each template uses the markup language called Mustache for rendering your
  html.  Mustache allows you to write html using variables and arrays to
  control the content.
  
  For more information, please refer to the Mustache documentation at:
  http://mustache.github.com/mustache.5.html

  of content.  Below is a list of pages found in a template, the URL used
  to access that page if known, and a brief description.
